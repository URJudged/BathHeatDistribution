# BathHeatDistribution

This code was written in MATLAB over the course of 4 days so it may be a bit buggy. It utilizes caloric theory to model heat in a bathtub. The goal is to determine the ideal human motion and hot water input from a faucet in a bathtub to maintain a uniform heat distribution at an initial temperature. There is an overflow drain so that the bathtub does not over fill from the constant input of water.
